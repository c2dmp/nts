When running a large language model (LLM) locally using Ollama, the ideal specifications and resource usage depend on the size of the model and the specific tasks you're performing. Generally, here's what you need to consider:

Ideal Specs

CPU: A multi-core processor is beneficial, but performance gains are more significant with a good GPU.
GPU: A dedicated GPU with a large amount of VRAM is ideal, as many models leverage GPU acceleration for faster processing.
RAM: At least 16 GB of RAM is recommended, but more may be required for larger models.
Storage: SSDs are preferable for faster loading times, with sufficient space for downloading and storing models.

Resource Usage

GPU: Most critical for accelerating model inference. The more VRAM, the better, especially for larger models.
RAM: Important for handling data and intermediate computations. Insufficient RAM can lead to swapping, which significantly slows down performance.
CPU: Used for pre- and post-processing tasks, but less critical if a powerful GPU is available.

Summary

GPU: Most significant impact on performance.
RAM: Necessary for smooth operation.
CPU: Helpful but secondary to GPU and RAM.
When configuring your setup, prioritize a powerful GPU and sufficient RAM for the best performance with Ollama.
